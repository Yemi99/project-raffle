# project-raffle

Project Overview: Smart contracts can be used for a variety of purposes. In this instance, we will investigate the use of smart contracts in Solidity to implement an Ethereum (Eth) raffle linked to participantsâ€™ Metamask wallets. This backend code for the raffle will be accessed through a website we will create with Wix (or Streamlit). Ultimately, this model of raffle could be utilized for fundraisers, lotteries, and more.

Decentralized Raffle (lottery)


<< Writing the contracts >>
1. Enter (for a fee)
2. Pick a random winner
    1. Autonomous. We never have to interact
    2. Provably random.

<< Building the Front End>>
1. Buttons, Streamlit or NextJS (React)
2. Deploy it in a decentralized context
